<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">24) Which are the necessary conditions to achieve a deadlock?</h3>
<p>There are 4 necessary conditions to achieve a deadlock:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong> At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode. If any other process requests this resource, then that process must wait for the resource to be released.</li>
<li><strong>Hold and Wait:</strong> A process must be simultaneously holding at least one resource and waiting for at least one resource that is currently being held by some other process.</li>
<li><strong>No preemption:</strong> Once a process is holding a resource ( i.e. once its request has been granted ), then that resource cannot be taken away from that process until the process voluntarily releases it.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Wait:</strong> A set of processes { P0, P1, P2, . . ., PN } must exist such that every P[ i ] is waiting for P[ ( i + 1 ) % ( N + 1 ) ].</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="n">Note: This condition implies the hold-and-wait condition, but it is easier to deal with the conditions if the four are considered separately.</h4>

<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">33) What is Belady's Anomaly?</h3>
<p>Belady's Anomaly is also called FIFO anomaly. Usually, on increasing the number of frames allocated to a process virtual memory, the process execution is faster, because fewer page faults occur. Sometimes, the reverse happens, i.e., the execution time increases even when more frames are allocated to the process. This is Belady's Anomaly. This is true for certain page reference patterns.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">34) What is starvation in Operating System?</h3>
<p>Starvation is Resource management problem. In this problem, a waiting process does not get the resources it needs for a long time because the resources are being allocated to other processes.</p>

<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">64) What is Process Scheduling In Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>The task of the process manager that deals with removing the active process from the CPU and choosing a different process based on a certain strategy is known as process scheduling.</p>
<p>An integral component of a multiprogramming operating system is process scheduling. Such operating systems provide the simultaneous loading of numerous processes into the executable memory, each of which utilizes temporal multiplexing to share the CPU.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">65) What are types of Process Scheduling Techniques in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>The types of Process Scheduling Techniques in Operating Systems are:</p>
<ol class="points">

</ol>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">66) What is Pre Emptive Process Scheduling in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>In this instance of Pre Emptive Process Scheduling, the OS allots the resources to a process for a predetermined period of time. The process transitions from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state during resource allocation. This switching happens because the CPU may assign other processes precedence and substitute the currently active process for the higher priority process.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">67) What is Non Pre Emptive Process Scheduling in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>In this case of Non Pre Emptive Process Scheduling, the resource cannot be withdrawn from a process before the process has finished running. When a running process finishes and transitions to the waiting state, resources are switched.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">68) What is Context Switching?</h3>
<p>Context switching is a technique or approach that the operating system use to move a process from one state to another so that it can carry out its intended function using system CPUs.</p>
<p>When a system performs a switch, it maintains the status of the previous operating process in the form of registers and allots the CPU to the new process to carry out its operations.</p>
<p>The old process must wait in a ready queue while a new one is running in the system. At the point when another process interrupted it, the old process resumes execution.</p>
<p>It outlines the features of an operating system that supports numerous workloads at once without the use of extra processors by allowing several processes to share a single CPU.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">69) What is the use of Dispatcher in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>After the scheduler completes the process scheduling, a unique application called a dispatcher enters the picture. The dispatcher is the one who moves a process to the desired state or queue once the scheduler has finished its selection task. The module known as the dispatcher is what grants a process control over the CPU once the short-term schedule has chosen it.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">70) What is the Difference between Dispatcher and Scheduler?</h3>
<table class="alt">
<tr>
<td>Dispatcher</td>
<td>Scheduler</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dispatcher is the one who moves the process to the desired state</td>
<td>Scheduler is the one which selects a process which is feasible to be executed at this point of time.</td>

<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">71) What is Process Synchronization in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>Process synchronization, often known as synchronization, is the method an operating system uses to manage processes that share the same memory space.

<p>We can recover the process from deadlock state by terminating or aborting all deadlocked processes one at a time.</p>
<p>Process Pre Emption is also another technique used for Deadlocked Process Recovery.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">79) What is paging in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>Paging is a storage mechanism. Paging is used to retrieve processes from secondary memory to primary memory.</p>
<p>The main memory is divided into small blocks called pages. Now, each of the pages contains the process which is retrieved into main memory and it is stored in one frame of memory.</p>
<p>It is very important to have pages and frames which are of equal sizes which are very useful for mapping and complete utilization of memory.</p>

<h3 class="h3">80) What is Address Translation in Paging?</h3>
<p>Logical and physical memory addresses, both of which are distinct, are the two types of memory addresses that are employed in the paging process. The logical address is the address that the CPU creates for each page in the secondary memory, but the physical address is the actual location of the frame where each page will be allocated. We now require a technique known as address translation carried out by the page table in order to translate this logical address into a physical address.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">81) What is Translational Look Aside Buffer?</h3>
<p>Whenever logical address is created by the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the page number is stored in the Translational Look Aside Buffer. Along, with the page number, the frame number is also stored.</p>

<h3 class="h3">86) What is Disk Scheduling in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>Operating systems use disk scheduling to plan when Input or Output requests for the disk will arrive. Input or Output scheduling is another name for disk scheduling.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">87) What is the importance of Disk Scheduling in Operating Systems?</h3>
<ol class="points">
<li>One Input or Output request may be fulfilled by the disk controller at a time, even if several Input or Output requests could come in from other processes. Other Input or Output requests must thus be scheduled and made to wait in the waiting queue.</li>
<li>The movement of the disk arm might increase if two or more requests are placed far apart from one another.</li>
<li>Since hard disks are among the slower components of the computer system, they must be accessible quickly.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h3">88) What are the Disk Scheduling Algorithms used in Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>The Disk Scheduling Algorithms used in Operating Systems are:</p>

<h3 class="h3">89) What is Monitors in the context of Operating Systems?</h3>
<p>A feature of programming languages called monitors and ithelps in controlledaccess to shared data. The Monitor is a collection of shared actions, data structures, and synchronization between parallel procedure calls. A monitor is therefore sometimes referred to as a synchronization tool. Some of the languages that support the usage of monitors are Java, C#, Visual Basic, Ada, and concurrent Euclid. Although other processes cannot access the monitor's internal variables, they can invoke its methods</p>
